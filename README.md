## Project Overview

This web application was developed as a midterm assignment for the Higher Institute of Science. It demonstrates modern frontend development techniques including:

- Dynamic tabbed interface
- Simulated REST API calls
- Asynchronous JavaScript operations
- Responsive design principles

## Features

 **Interactive Tab System**  
- 4 tabs with distinct menu item counts (3, 4, 2, 5 items respectively)
- Visual feedback for active tabs
- Persistent state management

 **API Simulation**  
- Realistic API call simulation with configurable delay (1500ms)
- Loading states and success messages
- Endpoint visualization

 **UI/UX Elements**  
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessible color scheme and contrast
- Hover and active state indicators

## Menu Item Counts

- Tab 1: 3 menu items
- Tab 2: 4 menu items
- Tab 3: 2 menu items
- Tab 4: 5 menu items
